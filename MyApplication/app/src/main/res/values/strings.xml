    <string name="ride_home_lyrics">Took a morning ride to the place\n\n
    Where you and I were supposed to meet\n\n
    The city yawns, they echo on\n\n
    My thoughts are spinning on and on my head\n\n
    It seems, they lead me back to you, ooh\n\n
    I keep coming back to you\n\n
    Took a morning ride, found a place up in my mind\n\n
    No one else can see\n\n
    Maybe, it\'s fate that we lose control\n\n
    In circles around, we go\n\n
    We become who we ought to know\n\n
    We just gotta let it go\n\n
    We just gotta let it go\n\n
    So, I\'m coming home to you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n
    You, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n
    You\'re all I need, the very air I breathe\n\n
    You are home, home\n\n
    Took a morning ride, gotta leave this all behind\n\n
    For with you is where I want to be\n\n
    Maybe, it\'s fate that we can\'t control (fate that we can\'t control)\n\n
    Oh, around and around, it goes (\'round and around, it goes)\n\n
    And all that we seem to know (all that we seem to know)\n\n
    We just gotta let it go\n\n
    We just gotta let it go\n\n
    So, I\'m coming home to you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n
    You, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n
    You\'re all I need, the very air I breathe\n\n
    You are home, home\n\n
    So many questions I\'ve thrown to the skies\n\n
    And all of the answers, I\'ve found in your eyes\n\n
    When I\'m with you, home is never too far\n\n
    And my weary heart has come to rest in yours\n\n
    I found my way home\n\n
    I found my way home\n\n
    I found my way home\n\n
    I found my way home\n\n
    I found my way home, I found my way home\n\n
    I found my way home, I found my way home\n\n
    I found my way home, I found my way home\n\n
    I found my way home\n\n
    So, I\'m coming home to you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n
    You, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n
    You\'re all I need, the very air I breathe\n\n
    You are home, home\n\n
    Coming home to you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n
    You, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n
    You\'re all I need, the very air I breathe\n\n
    You are home\n\n</string>
    <string name="lyrics">What if I told you that I\'ve fallen \n\n
    And I like the way you say my name? \n\n
    My heart skips a beat when I hear you calling  \n\n
    And I like that it won\'t go away  \n\n
    But never mind, don\'t wanna give you any trouble \n\n
    Never mind, never mind \n\n
    I\'m OK with being by your side for as long as I can hide \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? \n\n
    The heart-shaped arrow through my chest \n\n
    I\'ll make your breakfast every morning \n\n
    And pick you up when you\'re a mess \n\n
    But I know that it won\'t ever stop \n\n
    You know I\'ll be there when you call me whether you like it or not \n\n
    Without a warning, now I\'m falling for this picture on my phone \n\n
    But don\'t mind me, I\'m just falling, I\'ll be back up on my own \n\n
    Please don\'t say my name, help me put out this flame \n\n
    I\'d rather hold onto this feeling that you don\'t even believe in \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? \n\n
    Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? \n\n
    Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? \n\n
    Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? \n\n
    Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? (Nevermind) \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? (Oh, nevermind) \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? (Oh, nevermind) \n\n
    What if I told you that I\'ve fallen? (Oh, nevermind, I said nevermind) \n\n
    I shouldn\'t tell you that I\'ve fallen \n\n </string>
